🚀 Building and Securing an API for LLM Access with FastAPI and Ollama 🛡️
🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates how to create a secure API using FastAPI that interfaces with a locally run Large Language Model (LLM) via Ollama 🦙, implements API key authentication 🔑, and manages usage credits 💰. The goal is to provide a secure and scalable way to access the model while ensuring that usage is tracked and controlled.
